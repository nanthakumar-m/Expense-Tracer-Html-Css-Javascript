💸 Expense Tracker – HTML | CSS | JavaScript

The Expense Tracker is a fully interactive web application that allows users to manage their daily spending. Users can input expenses with relevant details like amount, category, and date. The app displays all entries in a dynamic table and provides real-time total calculation, category filtering, and basic edit/delete functionality.
 
 
The aim of this project was to gain practical experience with DOM manipulation, dynamic table generation, event handling, and array operations in JavaScript. It simulates a mini financial tracker
